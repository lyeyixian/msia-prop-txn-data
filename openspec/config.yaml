# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
#   context: |
#     Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
#     We use conventional commits
#     Domain: e-commerce platform

context: |
  Tech Stack:
  - .NET 10
  - ASP.NET Core
  - Entity Framework Core
  - Docker (for PostgreSQL database)

  Architecture:
  - Clean Architecture
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Standard .NET naming conventions (PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for parameters/variables)

  Domain:
  - Malaysian Property Transaction Data System
  - Source: Malaysia National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) web portal - https://napic.jpph.gov.my/
  - Extracts data from Tableau exports, stores in PostgreSQL database
  - Provides web interface for data analysis and visualization
  - Currently government portal data is hard to access/analyze

  Testing:
  - Unit tests in MsiaPropertyTransaction.Tests project
  - Integration tests for database operations
  - TDD approach - write tests first, then implementation

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours

rules:
  proposal:
    - Include clarifying questions for the user to answer
    - Do not guess user intent - ask for clarification on ambiguous requirements
    - Define scope clearly
  
  spec:
    - Follow Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) format
    - Use Given-When-Then structure for scenarios
    - Include acceptance criteria
  
  design:
    - Include Mermaid diagrams for complex flows or architectures
    - Diagrams are optional for simple scenarios
    - Focus on clarity over completeness
  
  tasks:
    - Each task should be completable in one small commit
    - Break down large changes into smaller, incremental tasks
    - Focus on single responsibility per task
